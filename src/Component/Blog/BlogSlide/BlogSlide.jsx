    <h1 class="Blog-title pb-3">Lighting Lanterns of Goodness</h1>
    <p class="Blog-text">As the holy month of Ramadan approaches, we all recall the good deeds we’ve planned to do but we weren’t lucky enough to have them all done. And, what’s a better time of the year than Ramadan to multiply these good acts and help people in need whether across our neighborhood or through an entity that serves a certain cause. Another act of kindness that is no less than giving to charity is gifting!</p>
    <p class="Blog-text">All year long we have so much to finish on our to-do lists, and we’re running all the time to get everything done; running errands, arriving early at work, getting kids from school, attending courses, and the list goes on, then comes a time where the tiniest extra thing just gets us bursting, as if it’s the straw the broke the camel’s back! For this, a little gift shall make a big difference, especially if it’s a surprise!</p>
    <p class="Blog-text">So, here’s how you can start! On Breadfast’s app, as you shop your groceries you can send your mom, best friend, or neighbor a surprise delivery from a wide variety of items that will double their happiness in the holy month, and without having to queue, look for a parking lot, or even go out!</p>
    <span>1- Qamar El Din, Flavored Sobia, and Hibiscus </span>
    <p class="Blog-text">Ramadan special drinks are an essential part of every iftar, and a collection of qamar el din, sobia with chocolate, sobia with mango, hibiscus and more is always a good idea for gifting.</p>

    <span>2- Yamish, nuts, and dried fruits </span>

Mix & match the nuts and fruits of your choice through a large variety on the app that are raw, roasted, plain, or with added spices. This one will thrill their taste buds.</p>

    <span>3- Basbousa & Konafa </span>
    <p class="Blog-text">It’s an old warm ritual to gift neighbors a plate of what you’ve prepared for dessert.
